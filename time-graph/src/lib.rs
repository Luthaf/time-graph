//! [`time-graph`] provides always-on profiling for your code, allowing to
//! record the execution time of functions, spans inside these functions and the
//! full call graph of spans and functions at run-time.
//!
//! # Core concepts
//!
//! There are two main concepts in this crate: [`CallSite`] identify a single
//! call site in the source, usually a full function. One can then create a
//! [`Span`] from any callsite, representing a single execution of the code.
//! When executed, the [`Span`] will its elapsed time, and store it in the
//! global call graph.
//!
//! # Controlling data collection
//!
//! By default, no data is collected until you call [`enable_data_collection`]
//! to start collecting timing data. Once you are done running your code, you
//! can extract collected data with [`get_full_graph`], and possibly clear all
//! collected data using [`clear_collected_data`].
//!
//! [`time-graph`]: https://crates.io/crates/time-graph
//!
//! # Overhead and limitations
//!
//! When data collection is disabled, this crate adds an overheard around 10 ns
//! when calling a function or entering a span. With data collection enabled,
//! this crate adds an overhead around 100 ns when calling a function or
//! entering a span.
//!
//! This makes this crate only useful for gathering profiling data on
//! function/spans taking at least 1 Âµs to execute.
//!
//! # Crate features
//!
//! This crate has two cargo features:
//!
//! - **json**: enables json output format for the full call graph
//! - **table**: enables pretty-printing the full call graph to a table using
//!   [term-table](https://crates.io/crates/term-table)
